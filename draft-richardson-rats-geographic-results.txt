            draft-richardson-rats-geographic-results-latest

Abstract

   Many workloads have limitations on what geography they are allowed to
   operate in.  This is often due to a regulation that requires that the
   computation occur in a particular jurisdiction.

   This document is about encoding a variety of geographical conclusions
   in an Attestation Result.

1.  Introduction

   Resolving the question of where certain computations occurs can be
   critical to assessing how much trust to put into the result.

   Example.  Example.  Example.

   [I-D.ietf-rats-ear] provides a framework that allows an [RFC9334]
   Verifier to return a conclusion as to geographic region for an Target
   Environment.

   While [RFC9711], Section 4.2.10 provides a very good WGS84 based
   location claim, often very suitable as Evidence, it is not ideal for
   the use by Relying Parties.  There are a few reasons:

   *  the latitude and longitude describe a location on the Earth.  The
      Relying Party is seldom interested in that level of detail.  It
      needs to know if it's in the correct place.

   *  the geographic position leaks significant amount of private
      information that is not necessary for the Relying Party to know.

   *  for many activities, it is the Legal Jurisdiction that matters,
      not the actual location.  Jurisdictions often do not have well
      defined concentric boundaries.  For instance, the Korean
      Consultate in Los Angelos is usually for Legal purposes, in Korea.
      Yet, only a few meters away, possibly below the level of WGS84
      accuracy, the jurisdiction would be different.

   This document offers a new set of structured abstract claims that
   provides an evaluated view of where a Target Environment is.  The
   mechanism to do this appraisal may depend upon a number of factors
   which may be related to physical geographic position, but also
   include other considerations.

   For instance, a claim that Target Environment is less than 1ns (as
   light travels in a fiber optic cable) away from another Target
   Enviroment whose location is known.  A typical fiber optic cable has
   a speed of 200,000 kilometers per second (slower than light in a
   vacuum to the index of refraction of the glass involved.  So if the
   round trip time between environments is 1ns, then the distance
   between Target Environments can be appraised to be within 1m of each
   other.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Claim definition

   This claim definition goes into the EAR submods map.  Mumble mumble.
   AR4SI + $ear CDDL TBD.

   Geographic Results can contain one or more of the following claims.

   1.   jurisdiction-country = ISO3361 country code.

   2.   jurisdiction-country-exclave = booleann

   3.   jurisdiction-state = country-specific list

   4.   jurisdiction-state-exclave = country-specific-list

   5.   jurisdiction-city = state-specific list

   6.   jurisdiction-city-exclave = state-specific-list

   7.   enclosing-exclave-country = ISO3361 country code

   8.   near-to = another entity+distance

   9.   rack-U-number = ordinal, numbered from bottom RU as 1.

   10.  cabinet-number = ordinal, DC specific ordering, might ignore
        hallway, room and floor

   11.  hallway-number = ordinal

   12.  room-numbr = string

   13.  floor-number = string, usually representing an integer.

   There are some additional things which may be received as Evidence,
   but which is sometimes important to convert to Results, having
   verified some aspects.  (TBD) 1. range-to-tower = designation of
   tower, distance-readings 2.

   (NOTE: There are apparently exclaves that ar inside other countries
   exclaves, like Nahwa.  Unclear if exclave information is even
   relevant, or if second order matters at all)

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to allocate TBD01 from the "CBOR Web Token Claims"
   registry [IANA.cwt], and TBD02 (suggestion: "ear.geographic-result-
   claims") from the "JSON Web Token Claims" registry [IANA.jwt].
